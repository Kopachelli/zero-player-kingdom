<p>Zero Player Kingdom started off as a legit stab at a 0-Player RPG but it’s now a playground for me to try out new languages and code concepts. Since there is a very clear roadmap for adding specific functionality, it’s a great platform for learning the unique aspects of a new language or coding style.</p>

<p>In this project you will find a directory for each language which ZPK has been developed in, with another README explaining how to compile and run it. </p>

<p>Official releases can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/azanebrain/zero-player-kingdom/releases">releases page</a>, or you can play (or not play?) <a href="http://azanebrain.github.io/zero-player-kingdom">ZPK online</a>.</p>
