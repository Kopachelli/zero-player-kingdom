# Zero Player Kingdom

ZPK is a programming excercise that has you learn the intricacies of a new language while creating a non-player, Space Viking, role playing game.

Since there is a very clear roadmap for adding specific functionality, itâ€™s a great platform for learning the unique aspects of a new language or coding style.

In this project you will find an orphan branch for each language which ZPK has been developed in, with another README explaining how to compile and run it. This branch will remain a static reference for the development roadmap.

# Roadmap

* TBD...

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you're learning a new language, I suggest forking this project and trying out the roadmap yourself. On the other hand, if I did something wrong, or a project could work better, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/azanebrain/zero-player-kingdom/issues/new) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/azanebrain/zero-player-kingdom/pulls). 

## Commits

Since there are so many subprojects make sure you define what project the commit focused on, following this format: 

```
PROJECT: Short description
[Extra line break]
Long description describing details of the commit, referencing issues and other relevant info
```

For example:

```
COFFEESCRIPT: Complete Battle Phase

Add Battle Phase which allows two units to fight each other
