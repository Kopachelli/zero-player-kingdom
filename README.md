# Zero Player Kingdom

Zero Player Kingdom started off as a legit stab at a 0-Player RPG but it’s now a playground for me to try out new languages and code concepts. Since there is a very clear roadmap for adding specific functionality, it’s a great platform for learning the unique aspects of a new language or coding style.

In this project you will find a directory for each language which ZPK has been developed in, with another README explaining how to compile and run it. 

Official releases can be found in the [releases page](), or you can play (or not play?) [ZPK online](http://azanebrain.github.io/zero-player-kingdom).

# Roadmap

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you're learning a new language, I suggest forking this project and trying out the roadmap yourself. On the other hand, if I did something wrong, or a project could work better, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/azanebrain/zero-player-kingdom/issues/new) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/azanebrain/zero-player-kingdom/pulls). 

## Commits

Since there are so many subprojects make sure you define what project the commit focused on, following this format: 

```
PROJECT : Short description
[Extra line break]
Long description describing details of the commit, referencing issues and other relevant info
```

For example:

```
COFFEESCRIPT: Complete Battle Phase

Add Battle Phase which allows two units to fight each other
See #42
```
